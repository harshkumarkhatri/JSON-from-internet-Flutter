# trying_rest_api

This is a flutter app which i worked on to learn about loading JSON data from an API call.<br>
I have previously worked on an app having API calls but was somewhat unclear with that so though of working on another app and to get myself clear with the concepts.
About the app:-
In this app, i have used a URL (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/albums/) for getting the JSON data on this URL call. A Future object of type async is used which is there to get only the JSON data from an Http.get request being made(for this i have added the HTTP dependency in pubspec.yaml file). The JSON output which is received after the call is decoded into and stored into a list variable which is used in-app to display the data from the received output.<br>
Things which are done in this app involves:-
<br>
* http.get request
* jsondecode
* Layout buildiing
* Widgets
* States
* Json data formating
* Future builder
* List builder

Built using:-
